# Fast Parser Combinator

without dependencies.

## TESTING

- using opam's ``utop`` to mess around with the parser;
- ``make -B ini.bytes`` to build it to byte code, other build methods in the ``Makefile``

## REFERENCE

- the idea comes from [this whitepaper](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf) about Monadic Parser Combinators
