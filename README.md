without dependencies.

## QUICK START

````
$ make
$ ./ini ./examples/example.ini

````

## REFERENCE

- the idea comes from [this whitepaper](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf) about Monadic Parser Combinators
- [this guy](https://github.com/tsoding) also did a video about this implementation
